      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding that our brains are not fixed but can continue to be moulded by experience, good or bad. This helps
        people believe more in their abilities to learn and adapt regardless of many conditions such as age, gendar, 
        job and education if the principles of neuroplasticity is used in positive ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives people hope and strength when learning something new but hard. It encourages people to push through
        by practicing harder unveiling their potentials, helps improve the learning experience to be more fun.
        It also helps the teachers teach better because the students are engaging better with the class.
      </p>
      <h3>How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
      <p>
        I will practice harder and more. I will engage with the class more. I won't give up easily when it's difficult but at the same time I will be more patient with myself.
      </p>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Play some video games, learn a new language, make art, music, photography, travel, exercise and socialise

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>What it is and why it is relevant?</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is a principle that we are not necessarily defined by our talents and early life experience. Our intelligence and human skills are not fixed but can continue to develop and grow by learning and experiencing new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        This mindset applies in almost every aspect and stage of our daily life, such as at work, at school, in our relationship with others, when making life decisions or going through life events, it helps us move forward by baby steps.
      </p>
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
        It is not about the "fake it until you make it" apporach but about staring small, being persistent and letting confidence and ability grow.
      </p>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I will apply the power of 'yet'. I will be patient with myself but won't give up when it's diffcult. I will be more open to challenges and opportunities to expose myself to "new things" when I feel reluctant to do so. I will put more effort in trying, and I will see failures as lessons learnt and I'm not good at it yet, than disapproval of myself.

      <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
      <h3>How these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy?</h3>
      <p>
        I will create a learning plan that starts small and stay persistent.
        I will seek feedback and take them constructively.
        I will include activities and studies that challenge me.
        I will utilise my class and engage more with my classmates and coaches.
