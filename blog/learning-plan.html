            <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>My long term goal is to become more capable of effectively adapting to evolution of new technologies such as Web3, AI and etc. and participating or leading a group on large projects.</p>
            <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>I think my biggest strengths will be my familiarity with programming and Agile as well as my experience and communication skills gained from working in the industry as a team memember. The biggest limitations will be presentation in front of people or leading a group as English being my second language.</p>
            <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be staying on top of the material and keeping focused for nine weeks because of other commitments such as gym, doctor appointments, social time etc.</p>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>
              I would like to see these non-technical skills developed in myself,
              <ul>
                <li>Improving your self-awareness and reflective skills</li>
                <li>Some leadership skills and presenting skills</li>
                <li>Giving and receiving feedback</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
            <p>Patience, some guidance when I feel lost in learning and encouragement</p>
            <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>I will prioritise and focus on my learning during the day at the bootcamp making sure minimsing distraction during the 9 weeks. Move closer to the campus to maximise the learning time. Engage with the classmates and facilitators as much as possible.</p>

            <h2>Foundations</h2>
            <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>My long term goal is to become a capable Full Stack Developer with modern tech skills to work on projects that I'm passionate about in the context of company, freelancing or open source community, as well as the human skills to be able to learn, keep growing and lead a team in a healthy working culture, and be happy.</p>
            <h2>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
            <p>I need some motivation or a target e.g. a challenge to solve or a bug to fix, when it comes to learning otherwise I might become bored and lose the focus. I think I've got discipline to stick to a given study programme created by others, but I tend to get lost when exploring and learning a new area by myself. I need to improve that.</p>
            <h2>3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>I think I need to develop further my skills of learning, giving presentations and leadership.</p>
