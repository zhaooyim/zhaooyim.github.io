            <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>My long term goal is to become a capable Full Stack Developer with modern tech skills to work on projects that I'm passionate about in the context of company, freelancing or open source community, as well as the human skills to be able to learn, keep growing and lead a team in a healthy working culture, and be happy.</p>
            <h2>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
            <p>I need some motivation or a target e.g. a challenge to solve or a bug to fix, when it comes to learning otherwise I might become bored and lose the focus. I think I've got discipline to stick to a given study programme created by others, but I tend to get lost when exploring and learning a new area by myself. I need to improve that.</p>
            <h2>3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>I think I need to develop further my skills of learning, giving presentations and leadership.</p>
            <h2>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
