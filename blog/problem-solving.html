      <h2>1. When I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem was: </li>
          <p>Could not access the value of a variable in a format string, e.g. "${name} is ${age} years old"</p>
          <li>The problem-solving techniques I used were:</li>
          <p>I used search engine, console output logs and error messages.</p>
          <li>How did I feel throughout the process? And what I learnt?
          </li>
          <p>It was a bit frustrating initially because there wasn't any obvious issue with the code except it just didn't work.
            And it felt great after finding the issue because I learnt about the difference between `` and '' in Javascript.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>2. When I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The problem: </li>
          <p>
            Could not modify the first letter of a string variable by accessing the index string[0] and assigning a new value to it
          </p>
          <li>The problem-solving techniques I used were:</li>
          <p>
            I used MDN for checking more details about String type, search engine on error messages, console logs and a online JS compiler for trying different solutions quickly.
          </p>
          <li>how did you feel throughout the process? What I learnt?</li>
          <p>
            I felt a bit challenged in a good way because I wasn't expecting that it wouldn't work and felt great because I learnt that JS doesn't allow that and instead I should used the replace method of String class.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>3. Reflections on each of the problem-solving techniques</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <p>Confidence level: Medium to high</p>
          <li>Trying something</li>
          <p>Confidence level: High</p>
          <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
          <p>Confidence level: Low to medium, because it doesn't feel as natural as talking to a real person to me</p>
          <li>Reading error messages</li>
          <p>Confidence level: Very High</p>
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          <p>Confidence level: Very High</p>
          <li>Googling</li>
          <p>Confidence level: Very High</p>
          <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
          <p>Confidence level: High</p>
          <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
          <p>Confidence level: Medium to high</p>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          <p>Confidence level: High</p>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>4. Reflections on a time I was reluctant to ask for help</h2>
      <p>
        I was a bit reluctant to ask about what "Super FizzBuzz" was referring to in a reflection question because my initial thought was it must be something I missed because I didn't study hard enough and the question was too minor so nobody would care.
      </p>
      <p>
        After confirming it wasn't that case, I went ahead asking for help in Discord and one of the coaches clarified that it was outdated document which should have been updated. After that, I felt great because I found a bug and raised it which might help others as well as it helped myself.
