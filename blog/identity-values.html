            <p>My personal values include authenticity, creativity, diversity, empathy, growth, hope, health and inner harmony.</p>
            <h2>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
            <p>I bought a hot meal for a homeless person on a street one cold winter evening. It was a quick desicion made on the spot. I didn't do it to look or feel good as it was dark and not many people around but felt rather a little bit uncomfortable because it didn't know how that stranger would react.</p>
            <p>I still went ahead because I felt empathy for the person in the cold and wet weather. I still think that was a right decision which indicates that empathy is part of me and I value that more than money and my own comfort zone.</p>
            <h2>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
            <p>Growing up in China, the school and society empthsised on knowledge, performance and competetion, so during my school years, 20s and early 30s, my goal was largely to "win" in life by doing better in study, earning higher income and social status than my peers, so I valued my possession and security over my inner voice, family and friends and my identity fluctuated between a successful individual or a underachiever depending on my performance.
            <p>After moving to NZ where the culture is less competitive and living here for 10 years being surrounded by more spiritual people, I have discovered more of my spiritual part and now consider following my inner voice and relationship with people in or outside work are as or more important than my possession.</p>
            <h2>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
            <p>I think my strengths include kindness, teamwork, willingness to help, professionality, integrity, open-mindedness, creativity and growth mindset, empathy, patience, prudence, self-regulation, easy-going-ness and they will support me during my learning journey.</p>
            <h2>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
            <p>After reflecting on the ups and downs of my career so far, I have found that hesitation when making decisions, risk-aversion, opportunism, overthinking, pride, perfectionism, shyness, short-term thinking, language or culture barrier, and self-sabotage are the factors that have affected my learning and career development so far.</p>
            <h2>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
            <p>I was working in a software quality assurance role at the time and was trying to introduce some QA practices to the developers at a start-up company which was trying to mature their SDLC.</p>
            <p>Coming from a more matured working culture, without being aware of the start-up mindset that many of the developers had, I started feeling my effort wasn't understood and appreciated but was seen as unnecessary extra workload or fluffy stuff hence some resistance.</p>
            <p>After realising that, I took a step back, and held various meetings to consult the developers including team-wide and one-on-ones with a few "difficult" guys to explain or teach them about the concepts with plain english and diagrams, while ACK-ing and addressing their concerns.</p>
            <p>I also reached to the Scrum master for some help facilitating the sessions and support.</p>
            <p>After the consultation, the team agreed to trial the process and during the trial period I led the effort by examples. After seeing the positive results of the change e.g. more bugs were caught early which actually ended up reducing the workload, even the most difficult developer became onboard and showed his appreciation for my effort publicly.</p>
