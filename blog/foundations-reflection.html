      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Growth Mindset; I had been lack of growth mindset in my previous career. Now I understand I need to be more patient and open to new opportunities.</li>
          <li>Reflection; I hadn't valued the importance of reflections and I wasn't good at doing it because I was always tempted to rush instead of sometimes slowing down and reviewing. Now I know that it will benefit my learning and life.</li>
          <li>Listening and loop; I can enjoy listening to others and looping.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>They play an important role in learning and programming. They are the guide which helps me understand my goals, my strength and weaknesses and make better plans in learning and career. They also make me a better person to work with.</p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>The power of 'yet'. How understanding neuroplasticity and having growth mindset can boost our learning and working performance.</p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>I found the most challenging aspects was reflection because I wasn't used to doing that. I've never spent so much time on reflecting on myself and looking internally. I had to change my mindset and way of thinking which wasn't easy.</p>
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>It's great and that's what makes this course stand out to me because with industry experience I understand that tech skills are not always necessarily the most what the companies look at. Being a better person is an important factor of becoming a great programmer.</p>
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p>Not really. Because I believed human skills were as important as learning programming skills and this belief made me being more willing to engage with learning human skills.</p>
